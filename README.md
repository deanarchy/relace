<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Hello world ðŸ‘‹ relace is a virtual marketplace where user can exchange... almost ANYTHING! ðŸŽ‰. From service, goods, favor, trivial thing, significant thing all you can think of!. This project is aimed to solving a real world problem where user don't know where to sell/buy the **things** that they need (or want or whims ðŸ˜†). In relace, there are only two: ***Customer*** and ***Provider***. Provider are the one who.. err you know, provides **things** and customer, it goes without saying are the one who buys **things**. Any user registered to relace can assume both roles.

### Nerd Zone ðŸ¤“
The relace system architecture is built on the microservice architecture with its common patterns. Although its unit is still comprised of coarse-grained services, it has improved the  scalability, agility, and reliability of the system while overcoming the shortcomings of the monolithic architecture. As the system grows, it may make sense to further break down the services. 

The event-driven microservices paradigm is used in the communication pattern to enable asynchronicity and loose coupling between services. To accomplish this basic pub/sub messaging is needed. AMQP (RabbitMQ) w/ topic exchange type is chosen in this project.

Every service in the system is written on **Typescript - Express.js** with each using **MongoDB** database. All service (excluding display service) serves as a representation of a domain that typically exists in an e-commerce/marketplace business. Only display service exists as a *CQRS* and *BFF*. Due to the infrastructure limitation, new functionalities are to be expected in the future.

When it comes to infrastructure, Docker is used to containerize each service. Each service is designed to run in a Kubernetes cluster to make scaling, replicating, and orchestration easier. Ingress NGINX is utilized as an API gateway for the outside world to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster internals. 

### Built With

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Mongoose (w/ Typegoose)](https://mongoosejs.com/)
